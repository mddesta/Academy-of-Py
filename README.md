## Background

Analysis of district wide standardized test results to determine trends in student performace. The raw data included every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The following analysis was performed: 

##### District Summary

## Conclusions

On average, students at charter schools outperformed those at district schools. This is especially true for math. Charter school studentâ€™s average math score average was 6.57 higher compared to average math score of district school students. Additionally, the average reading score of charter students was higher by 2.93. The percent of students with passing grades was also higher for charter schools - 27.07% in math and 15.79% in reading.

There was a very small performance difference between schools of small and medium size. However, students in large schools performed significantly lower than both small and medium schools. This is true for both math and reading. Only 69.96% of students in large schools received a passing score in math as compared to 93.55% and 93.60% of students in small and medium school students respectively. For reading, 82.77% from large school students received a passing score in reading compared to 96.10% and 96.79% of students from small and medium schools.
